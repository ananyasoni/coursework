Answer to Problem 6:

9645 of the random MSEs were smaller than the Iranian election MSE 
and 355 were larger or equal. This means that only about 3.55% of 
genuine elections would be as different from the uniform distribution as the 
Iranian election was. Given that, it is highly unlikely that the Iranian election 
was genuine, we are appoximately 96.45% confident that the data is fraudulent and we
can reject the null hypothesis.
The 2009 Iranian election null hypothesis rejection level is 0.0355 which is less
than 0.05.

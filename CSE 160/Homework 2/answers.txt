Problem 1: GC-content: 0.43059987061138255

Problem 2:
When I removed the gc_count = 0 line I got an error. This is because the variable isn't defined
and we try to increase its value to one. We must first initialize the variable to use it.

When I remove the initializing nucleotides I get the same error again because my program tries to use 
nucleotides without it ever being declared and initialized. 

Problem 3:
GC-content: 0.43059987061138255
AT-content: 0.5694001293886175

Problem 4:
G count: 5738773
C count: 5879128
A count: 7701287
T count: 7661547

Problem 5:
The sample_1, sample_2, sample_3, sample_4, sample_5, 
test-high-gc-1.fastq, test-high-gc-2.fastq, test-moderate-gc-1.fastq, 
test-moderate-gc-2.fastq all produce a different output for sum from
total count and length of nucleotides. Something to note is that the sum
is always smaller than the length and total. This is because some of the nucleotides 
have junk characters like N which is NOT a nucleotide. So we should only be increasing
our total count when we see either A, C, G, or T. Or we sould use sum of 
the nucleotides to calculate content. My previous answers to problems 2 and 0
are incorrect because the denominater included the count of non-nucleotide characters.


Problem 6:
AT/GC Ratio: 1.3223416174746196

Problem 7:
GC Classification: moderate GC Content

Problem 8:

Is suitable for nanotech: False


Collaboration:

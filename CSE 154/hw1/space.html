          <p>
            There are more stars in our universe than grains of sand in all of Earth's deserts
            and on all of its beaches. There are more than 200 billion stars in the Milky
            Way galaxy alone, 10% of which are similar to the Sun. Nearly a fifth of those
            Sun-like stars have an Earth-sized plant in the "habitable zone", meaning there are
            an estimated 4 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy. That number balloons to
            40 billion if you include planets orbiting red dwarfs. The closest one? That would
            be Proxima Centauri b, which orbits the closest star to the Sun, Proxima Centauri,
            a mere 4.2 light-years away. If you were traveling at the speed of the
            fastest-moving manmade object (the Parker Solar Probe), an amazing 68.6 km/s,
            it would still take 18,500 years to get there. So close, yet so far.

          <p>
            <strong>Space rovers </strong>are robotic vehicles designed for exploration on
            celestial bodies such as planets, moons, and asteroids.
            They serve as remote-controlled or autonomous platforms to
            conduct scientific experiments, gather data, and capture images
            in environments where human presence is either not possible or
            not practical.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Types of Rovers: </strong>Rovers vary in design and purpose depending on the
              mission objectives. Some are designed for surface mobility,
              traversing rugged terrain, while others are stationary, serving as
              landers or base stations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mobility: </strong>Rovers typically move using wheels or tracks, although some
              may use legs for improved mobility in certain environments. The design of the
              mobility system is crucial for navigating varied terrain and overcoming obstacles.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Examples of Rovers: </strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Mars Rovers: NASA's Mars rovers, such as Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and
                  Perseverance, have explored the Martian surface, conducting experiments to
                  understand the planet's geology, climate, and potential for past or present
                  life.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lunar Rovers: Rovers like the Soviet Lunokhod and the Chinese Yutu rovers have
                  explored the Moon's surface, conducting experiments and collecting data.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Overall, <strong>space rovers </strong>play a crucial role in expanding our knowledge
            of the solar system and beyond, enabling scientists to explore distant
            worlds and uncover new insights into the universe.
